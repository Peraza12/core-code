Task 1:
Compilation vs Interpretation

Compilation requires a compiler to compail the code from the source to 
binary for the PC to run the Pc.
Pro: faster, the main source kept private.
Cons: Not cross platform Windows/Mac, requires compiler.


Interpretating does not require a compiler, however, the program runs
slower than the compiled code.
Pros: Cross platform
Cons: Slower, public source.

Jit compiler helps to run interpreter code

Compiled languages: C, C++, Objective c
Tipically interpreted languages: PHP, javascript, Java, C#, Python.

Task 2:
Java language is compiled or interpreted?
Yes, it is compiled, since is a high level language and requires a compiler 
to translate the code to machine language.

But also considered interpreted because its source code is first compiled into 
a binary byte-code  executed by a java virtual machine (JVM).

Task 3:

Algorithm 
algorithm to calculate the equivalent of your local currencty to USD.
1- Calculate the equivalent from colones to dolar
2- 1 dollar = 0.11
3- 0.11 * N cantidad de dolares

Task 4:
Pseudocode read

Task 5:
Anwser to the question: Why is pseudocode helpful?
Is helpful since is a fake code or secuence of steps that can be written in common 
language and of 
course is informal with no sintax ruled to follow and this one acts as the bridge 
between computers and humans.

Task 6:
Create a pseudocode to calculate the aproximated age of a user base on the year 
they born, (you can define a variable with the actual year if you need it, like 
for example i could define Y <-- 2022)

To calculate the aproximate age of a user based on the year
1- we set the variables X = current year 2021 Y = N (year when the user born)
2- We substract X - Y = Year of birth which will give us the approximate age of the user.

Task: 7 
Read about flowcharts here //  DONE

Task 8:
Why are flowcharts important to us as developers?
Help us to simplify the tasks we have by creating these type of charts the information 
and steps to followed are easy to understand.

Helps us show how the code is organized.
Visualize the execution of a program within the code.
Show the structure of a website or app.
Understand how the users navigate thhrough a website or program.

The diagrams related and used within the code are:
-(UML) Unified model language
-(NSD) Nassi-Shneiderman Diagram: Used for the programming structure software
that was developed in 1972.
-Drakon diagrams: Is a visual programming language of algorithms used to create flowcharts.

Task 9:
Search about High-level languages and Low-level languages.

High-level languages are easy to understand for humans but complicated for machines and are
divided in compiled languages(The compiler reads the code and generates a low level code for the
machine to understand and then is organized to be executed in the computer) 
and interpreted languages (Read line by line and errors are de
detected until you get there).

Assembler is the best language based on low-level languages
